# Add User Application

This project is part of a course study on React.js put together by Maximillian Schwarzmueller.

It is a simplistic application that utilizes key concepts of React.js such as Components, props, lifting state and state management, styling, and passing functions between components.

This README will serve as a dev journal at least until project is completed.

Thank you for checking out what I am working on!

### Cheers!
